Plan
====

Want any shape, continuous movement. Chunks of multiple shapes move
together when they are connected by a lower chunk sitting over the
boundary.

Things are "coordinate free", which is a bit tricky. There are regions
of adjacent shapes. Need a notion of "accessible region", but this may
change as you move around and come up against other shapes.
