Plan
====

Want any shape, continuous movement. Chunks of multiple shapes move
together when they are connected by a lower chunk sitting over the
boundary.

Things are "coordinate free", which is a bit tricky. There are regions
of adjacent shapes. Need a notion of "accessible region", but this may
change as you move around and come up against other shapes.

Fuck it, let's do it in python:
* pysdl2/pyopengl for graphics? what a pain...
* pybox2d for physics
* Shapely for geometry

Shape
-----
* Has a parent chunk
* Has a position (relative to chunk)
* Has a poly

Region
------
* 
* Has a poly
* Has a list of shapes

Chunk 
-----
* Has a list of shapes
* Has a poly
* Has a parent region

Every step
