We are using math coordinates everywhere, so 
X goes right
Y goes up
Z means distances are 2^Z
Everything is oriented counter-clockwise

Imminent TODOs
--------------

* Fade out background layers -- DONE
* Specialise zoom to work one layer at a time, for simplicity?
* Draw grid lines with a constant screen width
* Zoom in instead of out?
* Add functions to recenter a chunk on a different origin and calculate the appropriate delta
* Move the correct chunk, not the one that currently happens to be the player
* Only allow moving when we are approximatly at the right visual zoom level


* Don't draw shapes that are outside the viewport 
* Fix the perimeter grid to fit exactly in the shape 

Possible TODOs
--------------

* Cache chunk information in Universe? I am currently recalculating it a lot
* Look up rational trigonometry? 


Code Cleanup
------------

* Replace 'rug' with 'bigint'
* Consistently use usize where we can?


Dream TODOs
-----------

* App Icon
