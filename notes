We are using math coordinates everywhere, so 
X goes right
Y goes up
Z means distances are 2^Z
Everything is oriented counter-clockwise

Gameplay Ideas
--------------

* Have a kind of square that doesn't change size with the rest of the level (if possible) so it would grow and shrink
  This would also mean we need two separate buttons for zooming in and out.

Imminent TODOs
--------------

* Don't crash if moving too fast.
* Zoom in instead of out?

* Specialise zoom to work one layer at a time, for simplicity?
* Draw grid lines with a constant screen width
* Add functions to recenter a chunk on a different origin and calculate the appropriate delta
* Move the correct chunk, not the one that currently happens to be the player
* Only allow moving when we are approximatly at the right visual zoom level

* Don't draw shapes that are outside the viewport 
* Fix the perimeter grid to fit exactly in the shape 

* Fade out background layers -- DONE

Possible TODOs
--------------

* Cache chunk information in Universe? I am currently recalculating it a lot
* Look up rational trigonometry? 


Code Cleanup
------------

* Replace 'rug' with 'bigint'
* Consistently use usize where we can?


Dream TODOs
-----------

* App Icon
